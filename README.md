This works on MVC structure. The working of MVC structure goes this way. It consists of 3 parts. Model, View and Controller. View Part is the one where the web Pages are viewed and the code part goes in here. Controller is the main function body or CPU of the structure where the view code of web pages are loaded and which makes it possible for the user to view the pages. Model is something which is responsible for connection with the database. If insertion, updation or deletion of values are required then it is done through model. Also the controller is responsible to send values to the model and to load model 
This Project consists of 4 pages. Home, About, Projects and Contact page. 
Home: Displays Slides and the associates’ name.
About: Displays the description of the company and its directors.
Projects: Displays the picture and description of projects completed.
Contact: I have introduced database connectivity in the contact page that will allow user to insert values into the database.
I have created a table named ‘contact’ inside the database ‘psarang_ci2’ in phpMyAdmin. Created 4 columns named, Name, Email, Phone number and message.
I have included the Header (header.php) and Footer (footer.php) pages in the includes folder that will be repetitive in all the pages. In the extra section I have provided the snippet of their code. Since this code is going to be repeated in all the pages I found it wise to include them in different pages and then call these pages on home, about, projects and contact page.

nice design
